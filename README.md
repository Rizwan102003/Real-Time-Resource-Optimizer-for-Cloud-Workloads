# Real-Time-Resource-Optimizer-for-Cloud-Workloads
A tool that dynamically analyzes and optimizes cloud resource utilization for cost efficiency and performance.

The project can involve the following features:

Real-Time Monitoring: Use Golang's concurrency capabilities to monitor cloud resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network) in real time.
Cost Optimization Algorithms: Implement algorithms to recommend scaling up/down resources based on current workloads, SLA requirements, and cost factors.
Visualization Dashboard: Create a simple frontend to display analytics and recommendations using frameworks like Gin for APIs.
Multi-Cloud Support: Add compatibility with popular cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure using their SDKs in Go.
Custom Alerting System: Send alerts via email or messaging platforms when thresholds are crossed or savings are identified.
Tech Stack:

Backend: Golang with Gin/Fiber for API, gRPC for inter-service communication.
Cloud SDKs: AWS SDK for Go, GCP SDK, or Azure SDK.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
Frontend: Use a simple framework like React or Vue.js to complement the backend.
DevOps Tools: Dockerize the application and deploy it using Kubernetes for scalability.
